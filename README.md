# Statistical_Data_Processing
1) Developed a statistical data processing program in C++, utilizing a Dynamic_Array class to efficiently handle and process large sets
 of floating-point data. Implemented the class using pointers, demonstrating proficiency in memory management and dynamic array manipulation. 
 
2) Successfully designed and implemented key class-member functions, including the default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, deep-copy 
assignment operator, subscript operator, size() function, empty() function, resize() function, and push_back() function. Ensured the correctness 
and efficiency of the program by adhering to best practices in class design and functionality. 

3) Effectively processed input data from an input file and generated accurate statistical results, including the number of data pairs, average values, standard deviations, correlation coefficient, and best-fitting line equation. Employed appropriate functional decomposition and modular programming techniques to enhance code readability and maintainability. Tested the program with various input files, validating its robustness and accuracy in handling different data sets.
